# Grafo
Functions to treat graphs and explore your features
 To Implement
 
 -Class Shortestpath() between two nodes
 
 -Class Tree() verify if a graph is a tree(if exist a loop this need the shortestpath() class, if diferencaCardinalidaVA() == 1, if ehConexo == true )
 
 -ehAnel() class,  checks if the graph has features of a ring topology 
 
 -ehEstrela() class, checks if the graph has features of a star topology
 
 -ehTotalmenteConexo , checks if the graph is totaly connected , if the number of arests = v(v-1)/2 *this is easy
